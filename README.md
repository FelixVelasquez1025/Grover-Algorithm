Grover's Algorithm in Qiskit
This project provides a Python script to create a quantum circuit that implements Grover's search algorithm using Qiskit. Grover's algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that finds a marked item in an unsorted database or solves for a target state in an oracle function with 
O(sqrt(N)) operations, offering a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms.

Overview
The repository contains a script that:

Initializes a quantum circuit in Qiskit.
Creates an oracle function to mark a target state.
Applies Grover's algorithm to amplify the probability of measuring the target state.
Runs simulations to validate the results.
The project is intended for personal educational purposes, aimed at enhancing familiarity with quantum computing principles, particularly within Qiskit.
