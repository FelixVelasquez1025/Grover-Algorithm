**Grover's Algorithm in Qiskit**

This project provides a Python script to create a quantum circuit that implements Grover's search algorithm using Qiskit. Grover's algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that finds a marked item in an unsorted database or solves for a target state in an oracle function with O(sqrt(N)) operations, offering a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms.

**Overview**

The repository contains a script that:

Initializes a quantum circuit in Qiskit.

Creates an oracle function to mark a target state.

Applies Grover's algorithm to amplify the probability of measuring the target state.

Runs simulations to validate the results.

***The project is intended for personal educational purposes, aimed at enhancing familiarity with quantum computing principles, particularly within Qiskit.***
